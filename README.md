#Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data( TASK -1)

## Description

This project aims to build a sentiment analysis model to classify social media posts as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of social media posts with labeled sentiments.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing special characters, stopwords, and performing tokenization.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
4. **Model Selection**: Choose a suitable classification algorithm such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or a neural network.
5. **Model Training**: Train the selected model using the preprocessed data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Deployment**: Create a simple web interface where users can input their own text for sentiment analysis.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Natural Language Processing libraries (NLTK, sklearn)
- Machine Learning frameworks
- Streamlit for the web interface
